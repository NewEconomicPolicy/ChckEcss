Hi Mark,
I suggest you unzip the file then edit the check_ecosse_setup.json and CheckEcosse.bat files to suit your file-system. 
Then create a short cut on your desktop to CheckEcosse.bat 
You'll need to add a couple of modules using pip or conda such as openpyxl and PyQt
It's a tad crude but should work...
Success! Mike
